[defaults/ports.yml](https://github.com/r-pufky/ansible_forgejo/blob/main/defaults/main/ports.yml)

## Dependencies

## Example Playbook
**STOP.**

WARNING
> Migrations from Gitea/Gogs in practice require manual intervention.
>
> ALWAYS backup databases and all repository data (or make a snapshot) before
> attempting a migration.
>
> Suggest creating a new container with data/db snapshots with Forgejo, then
> removing the old instance one confirmed working.
>
> [migration instructions](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/upgrade/from-gitea/).

Read defaults documentation.

Gitea migrations should be done **manually**: Gitea versions > `1.22` may not
be migratable. Only Forgejo `10.0.3` is guaranteed to safely migrate from Gitea
up to `1.22`.

This role explicitly manages each configuration parameter, and popular Gitea
roles will need to be re-evaulated before migration. ALWAYS BACKUP. See manual


Install 11.0.3 release of Forgejo; ensuring media files have proper
permissions. Version (and databases) will be migrated and updated on new
releases. Media permissions will be set to ensure Forgejo can read files.

``` yaml
- name: 'forgejo server'
